                { question: "Is this difficult for our employees to use?", answer: "No, it's significantly easier. Once the lightweight Cloudflare WARP agent is installed on their device, it works silently in the background. Users simply access their applications through a secure portal or directly via their browser, without the hassle of connecting and disconnecting from a VPN." },
                { question: "Does this work for applications still on our on-premise servers?", answer: "Yes. Cloudflare's connector technology allows you to securely expose on-premise applications to authorized users through the Zero Trust platform without opening inbound ports on your firewall, making it a perfect solution for hybrid environments." },
